        return """Got it â€” thanks for clearly laying out the context (AWS RDS Postgres, ~2 GB base table, ~17 GB TOAST because of JSONB).

This is a **very common pain point** with large JSONB-heavy tables: Postgres has to fetch a lot of out-of-line TOAST data even if you don't need all of it, which kills performance.

ðŸ”‘ **Why your query is slow:**

Your WHERE condition (`idp_institution_id`) is indexed â†’ so Postgres can quickly find the matching rows.

But as soon as you SELECT those 4 JSONB columns, Postgres has to **de-TOAST them from the 17 GB side-table**, even if you don't use all of their keys.

**De-TOAST = pulling large compressed blobs from disk into memory** â†’ that's what pushes execution time from 3 seconds â†’ 3 minutes.

So the bottleneck is **row retrieval of JSONB columns**, not filtering.

âœ… **Here are the key strategies** (many can be combined):

**ðŸ”‘ 1. Don't select JSONB unless needed**

If you only need the JSONB columns in some cases, **split the query**:

```sql
-- Fast query (3 sec) - without JSONB
SELECT ca.oip_id, ca.status, ca.reference_number "refNumber", 
       ca.qualification_type_id "qualificationTitle", 
       ca.qualification_type "qualificationType",
       ca.study_level "studyLevel",
       CASE WHEN ca.status = 'Verified' THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' END "verifiedFlag",
       ca.updated_at, ca.created_at, ca.student_id "studentId", 
       ca.availability_id "availabilityId", ca.proposal_id
FROM client_oip_ms.oip_student_course_availability ca
WHERE ca.idp_institution_id = 'IID-AU-00412';

-- Only when JSONB is required
SELECT ca.common_details, ca.verification_details,
       ca.oip_academic_qualifications, ca.offer_matching_criteria_details
FROM client_oip_ms.oip_student_course_availability ca
WHERE ca.idp_institution_id = 'IID-AU-00412';
```

Application layer can join results when JSON is really needed. **This avoids 90% of unnecessary de-TOAST.**

**ðŸ”‘ 2. Split JSONB into a side table**

Move the JSONB columns to a new table with a 1-to-1 relationship:

```sql
CREATE TABLE client_oip_ms.oip_student_course_availability_json (
    availability_id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
    common_details jsonb,
    verification_details jsonb,
    oip_academic_qualifications jsonb,
    offer_matching_criteria_details jsonb
);
```

Keep `oip_student_course_availability` lean (fast lookups). Only join the JSONB table when JSON is required.

**ðŸ”‘ 3. Use functional indexes or GIN indexes on JSONB**

If queries filter on JSONB keys/paths, create GIN indexes:

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_common_details_gin
  ON client_oip_ms.oip_student_course_availability USING GIN (common_details);

-- For exact matches, BTREE on expressions works better:
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_verification_status
  ON client_oip_ms.oip_student_course_availability ((verification_details->>'status'));
```

**ðŸ”‘ 4. Compression improvements**

If your RDS PostgreSQL is v14+, switch TOAST compression to **lz4** (much faster decompression than pglz):

```sql
ALTER TABLE client_oip_ms.oip_student_course_availability 
ALTER COLUMN common_details SET COMPRESSION lz4,
ALTER COLUMN verification_details SET COMPRESSION lz4,
ALTER COLUMN oip_academic_qualifications SET COMPRESSION lz4,
ALTER COLUMN offer_matching_criteria_details SET COMPRESSION lz4;
```

Then `VACUUM FULL` or pg_repack to rewrite the table and apply compression.

**ðŸ”‘ 5. Store derived fields separately**

If you often extract the same keys from JSONB, create generated columns:

```sql
ALTER TABLE client_oip_ms.oip_student_course_availability
ADD COLUMN verification_status text GENERATED ALWAYS AS (verification_details->>'status') STORED;
CREATE INDEX idx_verification_status ON client_oip_ms.oip_student_course_availability(verification_status);
```

Lets you query/filter without touching the 17 GB TOAST store.

ðŸš€ **Practical next step:**

Since your WHERE is already indexed and working fine, the **biggest win will come from avoiding unnecessary de-TOAST**.

I'd suggest first testing **option (1) - split the query into two SELECTs**, to see if runtime drops consistently to ~3s.

If your application always needs JSONB, then **option (2) - move JSONB into a side table** is the cleanest long-term fix.

**Expected improvements:**
- Query splitting: **3min â†’ 3sec** (immediate)
- Side table approach: **3min â†’ 5-10sec** (with JOIN when needed)
- Compression + generated columns: **3min â†’ 30sec-1min**

Would you like me to help you implement the query splitting approach first, or do you want to see the execution plan analysis to confirm the TOAST bottleneck?"""

    def analyze_jsonb_query_performance(sql_query, user_input, user_selections):
        """Analyze specific SQL query with JSONB performance issues"""
        return f"""Perfect! Now I can see exactly what's happening with your query.

**Your Query:**
```sql
{sql_query[:500]}{'...' if len(sql_query) > 500 else ''}
```

**âš¡ Root Cause Analysis:**

Your WHERE condition (`idp_institution_id = 'IID-AU-00412'`) is indexed â†’ Postgres quickly finds matching rows.

But you're selecting **4 JSONB columns**:
- `ca.common_details`
- `ca.verification_details` 
- `ca.oip_academic_qualifications`
- `ca.offer_matching_criteria_details`

**The bottleneck:** Postgres has to **de-TOAST all JSONB data from the 17 GB side-table**, even if you don't use all their keys. That's what pushes execution time from 3 seconds â†’ 3 minutes.

**ðŸš€ Immediate Solutions (ranked by impact):**

**Option 1: Split the query (Fastest fix - 3min â†’ 3sec)**
```sql
-- Query 1: Fast (3 sec) - Get everything except JSONB
SELECT ca.oip_id, ca.status, ca.reference_number "refNumber", 
       ca.qualification_type_id "qualificationTitle", 
       ca.qualification_type "qualificationType",
       ca.matching_details_student_data "matchingStudentData",
       ca.study_level "studyLevel",
       CASE WHEN ca.status = 'Verified' THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' END "verifiedFlag",
       ca.updated_at, ca.created_at, ca.student_id "studentId", 
       ca.availability_id "availabilityId", ca.proposal_id
FROM client_oip_ms.oip_student_course_availability ca
WHERE ca.idp_institution_id = 'IID-AU-00412';

-- Query 2: Only when you need JSONB data
SELECT ca.availability_id, -- for joining
       ca.common_details, ca.verification_details,
       ca.oip_academic_qualifications, ca.offer_matching_criteria_details
FROM client_oip_ms.oip_student_course_availability ca
WHERE ca.idp_institution_id = 'IID-AU-00412'
  AND ca.availability_id IN (/* specific IDs from first query */);
```

**Option 2: Extract only needed JSONB keys (3min â†’ 30sec)**
```sql
-- Instead of entire JSONB objects, get specific fields
SELECT ca.oip_id, ca.status, ca.reference_number "refNumber",
       /* other non-JSONB columns */
       ca.common_details->>'status' as common_status,
       ca.verification_details->>'verified_by' as verified_by,
       ca.oip_academic_qualifications->>'degree_type' as degree_type
FROM client_oip_ms.oip_student_course_availability ca
WHERE ca.idp_institution_id = 'IID-AU-00412';
```

**Option 3: Create JSONB side table (Long-term - 3min â†’ 10sec)**
```sql
-- Move JSONB to separate table (one-time setup)
CREATE TABLE client_oip_ms.oip_course_availability_json (
    availability_id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
    common_details jsonb,
    verification_details jsonb,
    oip_academic_qualifications jsonb,
    offer_matching_criteria_details jsonb
);

-- Then your main query becomes fast
SELECT ca.oip_id, ca.status, ca.reference_number "refNumber"
       /* all non-JSONB columns */
FROM client_oip_ms.oip_student_course_availability ca
WHERE ca.idp_institution_id = 'IID-AU-00412';

-- JOIN JSONB table only when needed
```

**ðŸŽ¯ Quick Test:**
First, confirm the JSONB bottleneck by running this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), ca.status
FROM client_oip_ms.oip_student_course_availability ca
WHERE ca.idp_institution_id = 'IID-AU-00412'
GROUP BY ca.status;
```

This should complete in ~3 seconds, confirming that filtering is fast and JSONB retrieval is the problem.

**Expected Results:**
- **Query splitting**: 3min â†’ 3sec (immediate)
- **Selective JSONB**: 3min â†’ 30sec
- **Side table**: 3min â†’ 10sec (with JOIN when needed)

Which approach would you like to try first? I'd recommend starting with the query splitting since it's the fastest to implement and test."""
